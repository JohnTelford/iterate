<h1 id="m-v-p">Minimum Viable Product</h1>

The first goal of website development projects is a Minimum Viable Product.

It is a way to understand whether the website project idea work or not. It is a stage in website development where the must features are implemented and ready to test with end-users. It gives feedback about the positive aspects and shortcomings.

The next steps are adding the want features, until stakeholders agree the website is production quality and ready to be deployment.

## Key Components

GitHub[^GitHub] and Git[^Git] are the heart of the Development stack. GitHub is a distributed version control system. Along with the Linux operating system, Linus Torvalds created the `git` version control system to manage Linux development.


## Understanding Version Control

Version control, also known as source control, tracks and managing changes to project software and documentation. The version control
software tools  enable software and documentation teams to manage modifications to source code and documentation as time passes.

When a `git clone` command is use
Git on repository is `clone`, the target repository remains shared amongst all of the developers who had previously contributed to it. Other developers who had previously contributed to that codebase will continue to push their changes and pull updates from the cloned repository. Any developer who clones a repository can synchronize their copy of the codebase with any updates made by fellow developers.

# Iterative Website Development

An Iterative Website Development project is  design, coding, documenting, and testing teams working together on pieces of the website in parallel. This style of development helps speed up the development process by breaking down large, complex problems into smaller tasks that can be worked on in parallel.

## Minimum Viable Product

The first goal of website development projects is a Minimum Viable Product.

It is a way to understand whether the website project idea will work or not. It is a stage in website development where the must features are implemented and ready to test with end-users. It gives feedback about the positive aspects and shortcomings.

The next steps are adding the want features, until stakeholders agree the website is production quality and ready to be deployment.
